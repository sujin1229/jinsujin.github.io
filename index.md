Hi! 👋 I'm **Sujin Jin**, a first-year graduate student in **Civil Engineering** at **[Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu)**.  
I am currently conducting research at the [SCIT Lab (Smart Computing for Infrastructure Technology)](https://sites.google.com/view/skkuscit), where we explore the convergence of AI and civil infrastructure systems.

My current research interests include:

- 🏗️ **Computer Vision** applications in structural inspection (e.g., concrete crack detection)
- 🔍 **Multimodal data fusion** from NDT sensors (e.g., GPR, IE, UT)
- 📊 **Explainable AI** and reasoning using large language models like GPT-4 and fine tuning LLM
- ⚙️ **YOLO-based automatic labeling** for defect datasets

I'm currently working on a project to develop a reasoning system that fuses vision-language models with domain-specific sensor data to improve damage diagnosis in civil infrastructure.  

You can explore my recent [projects](/projects/) and [publications](/publications/) to learn more about my work.

Feel free to [contact me](/files/cv.pdf) or check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/sujin1229).  

Thanks for visiting! 🌟
